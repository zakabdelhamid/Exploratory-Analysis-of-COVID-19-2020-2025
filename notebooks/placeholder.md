## Key Insights

### 1. Global pandemic dynamics
- The cumulative curves show a continuous rise in global cases and deaths until early **2023**, when both indicators reach a plateau. This marks the end of large synchronized waves and the transition to low-level circulation.
- Daily indicators reveal several **major global waves**, with the most intense peaks in **early 2022** and **early 2023**. Mortality waves follow infection waves with the expected delay.
- From **2024 onward**, daily new cases and deaths remain close to zero, indicating stabilization of the pandemic globally.

### 2. Vaccination rollout and its effects
- Global vaccination increases rapidly during **2021–2022**, surpassing **60%** of the world population fully vaccinated, then stabilizes around **70–75%** from **2023**.
- The before/after analysis shows that most countries experience a **substantial decline in average daily deaths** after their vaccination rollout.  
- A smaller number of countries display higher post-rollout mortality, generally due to **late pandemic waves**, **insufficient coverage**, or **delayed exposure to high-transmission variants**.

### 3. Continental heterogeneity
- **Europe and Oceania** record the highest infection levels (>330,000 cases per million), reflecting intense and well-documented transmission.
- **North and South America** show intermediate case levels but **very high mortality**, with **South America** showing the highest deaths per million.
- **Asia** displays lower recorded case and death rates, suggesting more contained spread or differences in detection and reporting.
- **Africa** reports the lowest values for both indicators, which likely reflects a combination of **younger demographics**, **lower recorded transmission**, and **underreporting**.

### 4. Vaccination, demographics, and mortality
- At the country level, the vaccination–mortality scatter shows **strong heterogeneity**: for similar vaccination levels, total deaths per million vary widely.
- The near-flat regression line indicates that **vaccination levels alone cannot explain cumulative mortality**. Early waves, demographic structure, healthcare capacity, and reporting practices act as major confounders.
- The life expectancy vs mortality scatter shows an upward trend: countries with **longer life expectancy** tend to have **higher deaths per million**, due to **larger elderly populations** more vulnerable to severe outcomes.

### 5. Stringency policies and transmission
- Among the countries with the **highest average stringency index**, transmission levels remain **very variable**. Some highly strict countries show reduced infections, while others register strong waves. Strictness alone does not determine outcomes.
- Countries with the **highest volatility** in policy strictness do not consistently achieve lower transmission. Frequent tightening and relaxing of restrictions often coincide with **reactive policy cycles** and **fluctuating epidemic pressure**.
- Both visuals indicate that epidemic outcomes depend on **timing, enforcement, compliance, population structure, and testing intensity** in addition to policy strictness.
